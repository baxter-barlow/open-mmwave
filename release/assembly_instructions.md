# Assembly Instructions - open_mmwave Rev G

## Pre-Assembly Checklist
- ESD precautions and grounding
- Solder paste selection and storage
- Reflow profile compatible with BGA/QFN devices
- Stencil thickness (verify with CM)

## Assembly Sequence
1. Place bottom-side components first (if applicable).
2. Place critical power components (U1, U19, inductors, diodes).
3. Place BGA device (U2) with verified pick-up and alignment.
4. Place fine-pitch devices (U3, U16).
5. Place remaining passives and connectors.

## Post-Assembly Inspection
- Visual inspection for polarity and orientation.
- X-ray inspection for BGA solder joints (U2).
- AOI for passives and fine pitch.

## Rework Procedures
- Use localized hot-air rework for QFN/SON devices.
- BGA reballing requires controlled rework station.
- Inspect pads for damage and repair if needed.
